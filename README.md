# A Closer Look at Few-shot Classification

This repo contains the reference source code for the paper [A Closer Look at Few-shot Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04232) in International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2019). In this project, we provide a integrated testbed for a detailed empirical study for few-shot classification.

## Enviroment
 - Python3
 - [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) before 0.4 (for newer vesion, please see issue #3 )
 - json

## Getting started
### CUB
* Change directory to `./filelists/CUB`
* run `source ./download_CUB.sh`

### mini-ImageNet
* Change directory to `./filelists/miniImagenet`
* run `source ./download_miniImagenet.sh` 

(WARNING: This would download the 155G ImageNet dataset. You can comment out correponded line 5-6 in `download_miniImagenet.sh` if you already have one.) 

### mini-ImageNet->CUB (cross)
* Finish preparation for CUB and mini-ImageNet and you are done!

### Omniglot
* Change directory to `./filelists/omniglot`
* run `source ./download_omniglot.sh` 

### Omniglot->EMNIST (cross_char)
* Finish preparation for omniglot first
* Change directory to `./filelists/emnist`
* run `source ./download_emnist.sh`  

### Self-defined setting
* Require three data split json file: 'base.json', 'val.json', 'novel.json' for each dataset  
* The format should follow   
{"label_names": ["class0","class1",...], "image_names": ["filepath1","filepath2",...],"image_labels":[l1,l2,l3,...]}  
See test.json for reference
* Put these file in the same folder and change data_dir['DATASETNAME'] in configs.py to the folder path  

## Train
Run
```python ./train.py --dataset [DATASETNAME] --model [BACKBONENAME] --method [METHODNAME] [--OPTIONARG]```

For example, run `python ./train.py --dataset miniImagenet --model Conv4 --method baseline --train_aug`  
Commands below follow this example, and please refer to io_utils.py for additional options.

## Save features
Save the extracted feature before the classifaction layer to increase test speed. This is not applicable to MAML, but are required for other methods.
Run
```python ./save_features.py --dataset miniImagenet --model Conv4 --method baseline --train_aug```

## Test
Run
```python ./test.py --dataset miniImagenet --model Conv4 --method baseline --train_aug```

## Results
* The test results will be recorded in `./record/results.txt`
* For all the pre-computed results, please see `./record/few_shot_exp_figures.xlsx`. This will be helpful for including your own results for a fair comparison.

## Docker
If you want to use Docker, build the container with `docker build -t closerlookfewshot .`
and execute commands with `docker run -v  $(pwd):/repo closerlookfewshot [command]`,
e.g. `docker run -v  $(pwd):/repo closerlookfewshot python3 /repo/train.py --dataset CUB --model Conv4 --method baseline --train_aug`.

If you have a GPU and CUDA and cudnn installed, use `nvidia-docker build -t closerlookfewshot -f Dockerfile-gpu .`
and `nvidia-docker run -v  $(pwd):/repo closerlookfewshot [command]`,
e.g. `nvidia-docker run -v  $(pwd):/repo closerlookfewshot python3 /repo/train.py --dataset CUB --model Conv4 --method baseline --train_aug`.
Change the CUDA version in `10.2-cudnn7-runtime-ubuntu16.04` (`Dockerfile-gpu`) if you have another version than 10.2.

## FAQ
* Q1 Why some of my reproduced results for CUB dataset are around 4~5% with you reported result? (#31, #34, #42)
* A1 Sorry about my reported the results on the paper may run in different epochs or episodes, please see each issue for details.

* Q2 Why some of my reproduced results for mini-ImageNet dataset are around 1~2% different with your reported results? (#17, #40, #41 #43)
* A2 Due to random initialization, each training process could lead to different accuracy. Also, each test time could lead to different accuracy.

* Q3 How do you decided the mean and the standard variation for dataset normalization? (#18, #39)
* A3 I use the mean and standard variation from ImageNet, but you can use the ones calculated from your own dataset. 

* Q4 Do you have the mini-ImageNet dataset available without downloading the whole ImageNet? (#45 #29)
* A4 You can use the dataset here https://github.com/oscarknagg/few-shot, but you will need to modify filelists/miniImagenet/write_miniImagenet_filelist.py.
